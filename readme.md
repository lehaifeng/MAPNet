​         *Structure of the proposed MAP-Net, which composed of three modules (A) Detail preserved multipath feature extract network; (B) Attention based features adaptive Squeeze and global spatial pooling enhancement module; (C) Up sampling and building footprint extraction module. Conv block is composed of series residual modules to extract features and shared with each path. Gen block generates new parallel path to extract richer semantic features on the basic of Conv block.*
